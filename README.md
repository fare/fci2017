Notes
-----

These ideas are based on my work with the TUNES project in the 1990s.
I made a presentation on this ideas at BostonHaskell in 2016,
with a video at <https://youtu.be/heU8NyX5Hus> and
the slides at <http://fare.tunes.org/files/cs/fci-bh2016.pdf>.
My resurrected PhD thesis on this topic (in progress) can be found at:
<http://fare.tunes.org/tmp/phd/thesis.pdf>.
