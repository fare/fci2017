Reflection with First-Class Implementations
===========================================

This is my rejected proposal for a paper at
[SNAPL 2017](http://snapl.org/2017/cfp.html).
It was too speculative for [the reviewers](reviews.text),
who had a hard time relating without an implementation.
Thus my next priority will thus be implementing the ideas.

There is also an HTML version, but the few math mode formulas
unhappily appear in a degraded way:

Notes
-----

  * These ideas are based on my work with
    the [TUNES project](http://tunes.org/) in the 1990s.

  * I made a presentation on these ideas at BostonHaskell in 2016,
    with a video at <https://youtu.be/heU8NyX5Hus> and
    the slides at <http://fare.tunes.org/files/cs/fci-bh2016.pdf>.

  * I also made a presentation at
    [Lisp NYC in 2017](https://www.meetup.com/LispNYC/events/237759785/);
    the video is still unavailable (ask for rushes),
    but the slides are at <http://fare.tunes.org/files/cs/fci-ln2017.pdf>.

  * My resurrected PhD thesis on this topic (in progress) can be found at:
    <http://fare.tunes.org/tmp/phd/thesis.pdf>.
