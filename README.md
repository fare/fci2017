Reflection with First-Class Implementations
===========================================

This is my rejected proposal for a paper at
[SNAPL 2017](http://snapl.org/2017/cfp.html).

Viewing the article

The PDF version of this article can be found here:

There is also an HTML version, but the few math mode formulas
unhappily appear in a degraded way:

Notes
-----

These ideas are based on my work with the TUNES project in the 1990s.
I made a presentation on these ideas at BostonHaskell in 2016,
with a video at <https://youtu.be/heU8NyX5Hus> and
the slides at <http://fare.tunes.org/files/cs/fci-bh2016.pdf>.
My resurrected PhD thesis on this topic (in progress) can be found at:
<http://fare.tunes.org/tmp/phd/thesis.pdf>.
